In this project, I am using data from Covid Deaths and Vaccinations to create 2 Dashboards.


The first dashboard provides a visual representation of COVID-19 deaths, offering insights
and trends based on the provided data. It aims to make it easy for users to explore and
understand the impact of the pandemic on mortality rates.
This dashboard includes:

-Global Numbers: A Table of the global total cases and deaths and the average death percentage.

-Total Death Count per Continent: A barplot that provides a clear and concise overview of the total
number of COVID-19 deaths across the continents.

-Total Infection per Country: A map that illustrates the COVID-19 infection rate by assigning colours
to countries based on the percentage of the infected population relative to the total population.

-Percentage of Population Infected per Month: A line graph that illustrates for specific countries
the percentage of the infected population per month and additionally the forecast for the following
months.
